Web scraping is a technique that is used for extracting HTML content from different websites. These web scrapers are mainly computer bots that can directly access the World Wide Web using HTTP Protocol and use this information in various applications. The data is obtained in an unstructured format, which is then converted into a structured manner after performing multiple pre-processing steps. Users can save this data in a spreadsheet or export it through an API.

Web scraping can also be done manually for small web pages by simply copying and pasting the data from the web page. But this copy and pasting would not work if we require data at a large scale and from multiple web pages. Here automated web scrapers come into the picture. They use intelligent algorithms which can extract large amounts of data from numerous web pages in less time. 

 

 Uses of Web Scraping
  

  Web scraping is a powerful tool for businesses to gather and analyze information online. It has multiple applications across various industries. Below are some of these that you can check out.

  Marketing: Web scraping is used by many companies to collect information about their products or services from various social media websites to get a general public sentiment. Also, they extract email ids from various websites and then send bulk promotional emails to the owners of these email ids.
  Content Creation: Web scraping can gather information from multiple sources like news articles, research reports, and blog posts. It helps the creator to create quality and trending content.
  Price Comparison: Web scraping can be used to extract the prices of a particular product across multiple e-commerce websites to give a fair price comparison for the user. It also helps companies fix the optimal pricing of their products to compete with their competitors.
  Job Postings: Web Scraping can also be used to collect data on various job openings across multiple job portals so that this information can help many job seekers and recruiters.
  Now, we will create a simple web scraper using Python and Beautiful Soup library. We will parse an HTML page and extract useful information from it. This tutorial requires a basic understanding of Python as its only prerequisite.

## Code implementation
Our implementation consists of four steps which are given below:
